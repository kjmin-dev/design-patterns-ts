# Design Patterns in TypeScript

This repository contains implementations of various design patterns using TypeScript.
The purpose of this project is to provide simple & understandable examples of commonly used design patterns in software development.

## Status

#### Creational Patterns

-   [x] **Abstract Factory**: Provides an interface for creating related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
-   [ ] **Factory Method**:
-   [ ] **Singleton**:
-   [x] **Builder**: Separates the construction and representation of complex objects, enhancing flexibility and maintainability.

#### Structural Patterns

-   [x] **Adapter**: Provides an interface for incompatible objects to work together.
-   [x] **Decorator**: Allows behavior to be added to individual objects, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class.
-   [ ] **Facade**

#### Behavioral Patterns

-   [x] **Strategy**: Allows selecting an algorithm at runtime, promoting flexibility and reusability.
-   [x] **Observer**: Eestablishes a one-to-many relationship, ensuring dependents are automatically notified of state changes.
-   [ ] **Command**:
